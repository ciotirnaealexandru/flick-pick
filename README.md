### Frontend

- **Flutter (Dart)** - page routing, creating pages and components, color themes (future dark mode), connecting .envs, auth services (retrieving info from the backend with `package:http/http.dart`), creating models (user_model, show_model), form validation, keeping JWTs with `package:flutter_secure_storage/flutter_secure_storage.dart`, mapping images on a grid (for future cacheing)

### Backend

- **PostgreSQL** and **Prisma ORM** - setting up database seeding, user Roles (USER, ADMIN), User, custom UserShows
- **Express.js** + **Javascript** - endpoint routing, middlewares for route protection (only certain users or only admin guards), JWT token authorization, User CRUD (and /login, /signup, /me)
- **TMDB API** - connected with Express.js backend (retrieve popular shows, or by name, by id, get user season information, text parsing, cleaning up jsons)

## 4. Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **PostgreSQL**: Set up a PostgreSQL database instance.
- **Flutter**: Setup Flutter on your computer (for more details, check out the [Flutter Docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)).

### Clone the **GitHub Repository**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ciotirnaealexandru/flick-pick.git
```

### Frontend Setup

- Create a `.env` file in `/frontend` and copy the text from `.env.example`. Adjust the **environment variables** as explained in the file.

- Install the **dependencies**:

  ```sh
  cd ./frontend
  flutter pub get
  ```

- Start an **emulator** via _Android Studio_ or **connect a phone** with _USB debugging enabled_.

- Run the frontend:

  ```sh
  flutter run
  ```

### Backend Setup

- Create a **PostgreSQL database instance**.

- Create a `.env` file in `/backend` and copy the text from `.env.example`. Adjust the **environment variables** as explained in the file.

- Install the **dependencies**:

  ```sh
  cd ./backend
  npm install
  ```

- After you have a PostgreSQL database instance running, **prepare the database**:

  ```sh
  npx prisma db push
  npx prisma generate
  ```

- **Seed** the database:

  ```sh
  npm run seed
  ```

- Run the backend:

  ```sh
  npm run start
  ```

### Recommended for development

- **Insomnia**: For testing endpoints.
- **Android Studio**: For resolving dependencies, SDK issues and emulators.

### Recommended for feature planning

- **Trello**: For project tracking.
- **Figma**: For UI/UX design.
